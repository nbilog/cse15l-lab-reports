After installing VSCode, and opening up the application, your VSCode window should look like the picture above.
## Step 2: Remotely Connecting
If on a windows system, first you need to install a program called OpenSSH which is a program that will connect your computer to other computers that have this account.  
Follow these steps to [Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)  
Next you will need to look up your course-specific account for CSE15L here: [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)  
Your account name should be found under "Additional Accounts".  
Now using Visual Studio Code, we will connect to the remote computer using VSCode's remote option.
